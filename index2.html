  <h3>The breakdown</h3>

<p>Martin O'Neill's side are now guaranteed at least a play-off spot in
   Group D of the European Qualifiers, and can qualify automatically
    if they win in Poland on Sunday.

Southampton forward Long fired past Manuel Neuer from
 15 yards after getting behind the German defence just
  five minutes after coming on the pitch

  Thomas Muller missed a fine chance to
   equalise at the other end in the closing
    stages, but Ireland held on for a crucial
     win, and after Scotland's 2-2 draw against
      Poland, have a fine chance of reaching their
       second consecutive European Championships.

  Ireland soaked up pressure from the world champions in the first half,
   but Germany only went close on two occasions in front of a
    packed Aviva Stadium.

  lkay Gundogan saw his effort from 18 yards blocked superbly
   by John O'Shea as it headed goalwards, before Mesut Ozil's
    left-footed effort on the stretch clipped the side of the
     post and went wide after Muller had cut the ball back.</p>


<br>


    <p> Substitute Andre Schurrle went
       close after the break from a speedy
        German counter-attack, hitting his
         first-time volley over the bar from Marco Reus'
       cross, but the Irish took a shock lead shortly after.

       Long, who had replaced Daryl
        Murphy just five minutes earlier,
         got on to a long punt upfield from
         Darren Randolph, and emphatically fired
         past Neuer to send the home crowd into raptures.
